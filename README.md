# BLAKE3 WASM — Auditable Build

Minimal wrapper around the official [BLAKE3](https://github.com/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3) hash function for browser use. No pre-built WASM is committed — auditors build from source.

## Security Audit Guide

1. **`build.sh`** (~80 lines) — clones BLAKE3 at tag `1.8.3` (pinned), scaffolds two tiny Rust crates, builds with `wasm-pack`, cleans up
2. **`blake3-wasm-single/src/lib.rs`** — 7 lines: calls `blake3::hash()` and returns bytes
3. **`blake3-wasm-rayon/src/lib.rs`** — 22 lines: uses `blake3::Hasher` with `update_rayon()` for parallel hashing above 16 KB
4. Run `./build.sh` (or `.\build.ps1` on Windows) to build from source
5. All Cargo.toml, config, and source files are generated by the build script — nothing hidden

## Build Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) (stable + nightly for rayon build)
- [wasm-pack](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/)
- Git

## Build

```bash
# Linux/macOS
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh

# Windows (PowerShell)
.\build.ps1
```

## Browser Demo

After building, serve the directory and open `browser-test.html`:

```bash
python -m http.server 8080
# Open http://localhost:8080/browser-test.html
```

Drop a file to compare BLAKE3 (WASM) vs SHA-256 (WebCrypto) throughput.

- If SharedArrayBuffer is available: parallel mode (4 threads)
- Otherwise: single-threaded SIMD fallback

## What Gets Built

```
blake3-wasm-single/pkg/   — single-threaded WASM module
blake3-wasm-rayon/pkg/    — parallel (rayon) WASM module
```

Both are gitignored. Build from source to verify.

## Design Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| No pre-built WASM | Auditors build from source to verify nothing is tampered |
| Build script generates all config | Only `build.sh` + `build.ps1` to audit |
| Pin BLAKE3 at tag 1.8.3 | Reproducible builds; matches crates.io |
| Two builds (single + rayon) | browser-test.html auto-falls back; both wrappers are tiny |
| Rayon uses nightly-2025-11-15 | Required for `build-std` with atomics/shared-memory |
